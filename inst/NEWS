0.1.19
  o improvement: ckecking if NA exists in coordinates and variables with a loops (faster than anyNA)
  o improvement: two matrix suppressed in parameters sended to rcppLissage
  o new function : constituerGrappes
  o new function : constituerMatriceEffectifs
0.1.18
  o improvement: kernelSmoothing uses armadillo matrix instead of NumericMatrix
0.1.17
  o improvement: kernelSmoothing with quantiles splits computation in parallel clusters (with RcppParallel) 
0.1.16
  o improvement: smoothingToGrid uses sf package instead of sp package
0.1.15
  o improvement: verbose output to console only if fUpdateProgress is not provided. (if provided, the output must be managed by the calling function)
  o improvement: use of left-value [, "var"] instead of $var
0.1.13
  o bug fixed: upper boundary of loop for was underestimated when bandwidth > neighbor * cellSize
  o bug fixed: the offset was wrong when dfCendroids was provided
  o improving window when looking for cells to send smoothed value
  o new argument for kernelSmoothing and smoothingToGrid: fUpdateProgress
  o neighbor argument is 0 if dfCendroids is provided
